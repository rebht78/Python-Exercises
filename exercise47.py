"""
In this and subsequent exercises, we'll learn more about lists.

Let's see an example.
"""
list1 = ['a','b','c',1,2]
# creation of list1

list2 = [3,4,5,6]
# creation of list2

# let's create list3 by adding list1 and list2
list3 = list1 + list2
# before printing the list, assume an answer

print(list3)
