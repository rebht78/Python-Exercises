# answer to challenge 1
# this was pretty easy - you just need to use print() function
print("I am learning Python and it is awesome!")

# answer to challenge 2
# this was a confusing question
# to determine type of any value use type() function
print(type('2.14')) # <type 'str'>
print(type(2.14))  # <type 'float'>

# why are they different: because whatever is in quotation, python
# assumes it as string.
