"""
Syntax of list creation again:

listname = [value1,value2,...]

we can print the whole list but what if I want to access one 
of the element of the list.

You can use index. Index starts from 0 in python.
so, first element is at index 0, last element is at index n-1
where n is the size of the list.
"""
countries = ['USA','Canada','India','Russia','United Kingdom'];
# we have just created the list

print(countries[0]) # print the first element
print(countries[2]) # print the third element
