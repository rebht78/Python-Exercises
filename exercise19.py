"""
In the previous exercise We got introducted to str.

Previously, we've use type to get the type of 'value'.

type, str, print and so many others are built-in functions
in python.

str is a function that converts non-string value to string value.

Let us see an example of it.
"""
number1 = 23
number2 = 32
sum = number1 + number2

# this will print 55
print(sum)

# let us change the values
name = 'Sherlock'
age = 32

# let us try to add name and age
# Are you kidding?
# you cannot add characters and numbers
# let's try
sumOfNameAge = name + age
print(sumOfNameAge)

# what you got?
