"""
In this set of exercises, we'll learn about variables.

Variables are named memory location.

Instead of referring values by values why not to create variables.
We create variables simply by giving them the value

<varname> = <value> 

that's it
"""
name = 'Sherlock' # created a variable name

# let's print it
print(name);

age = 32 # created a variable age with 32 as value

# let's print it
print(age);
