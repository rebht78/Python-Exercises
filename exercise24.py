"""
We have learn a lot about python.

Now let's move forward and learn Sequences or Lists.

Lists are collection of values.

Why we need a list in first place?

Let's say you need to store name of all the countries in the world
to store their GDP numbers.
You can go on and create 190+ variables for storing country name
or create a list of countries.

Let's see few examples of it.

Syntax of list creation:

listname = [value1,value2,...]

"""
countries = ['USA','Canada','India','Russia','United Kingdom'];
# we have just created the list

# you can print the list too.
print(countries)
