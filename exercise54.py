"""
A string is a sequence of characters
and list is a sequence of values. 

But list of characters is not same as string.

Let's see few examples related to list and string
"""
str1 = "This is a long string"

list1 = list(str1) # list is to use to convert string to list

print(str1)
print(list1) # you can see the difference.
