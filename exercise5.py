"""
In all the previous programs, we try to print something 
on the screen.

Starting with 'Hello World' to a number.

Let's now move forward with types in python.

Python has three basic data types.

Data Types help python in determining type of operations
you can perform with those data.

You can find out the type of any data using type() function
We'll understand what is the meaning of function in subsequent exercises.

# print a number and it's type
print(20)
print(type(20))

#print a real number [with a decimal] and it's type
print(3.14)
print(type(3.14))

#print a string and it's type
print('Hello, World') 
# anything in single or double quotation is a string
print(type('Hello, World'))
